# Shutdown script

This is just a simple script with three options:

1. Shutdown/Reboot now

2. Shutdown/Reboot at a certain time

3. Shutdown/Reboot in a given amount of minutes

For easy acces you can put the .sh file into your home directory! This script
uses doas instead of sudo! If you still want sudo, simply replace doas with
sudo in the file.
